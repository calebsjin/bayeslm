# Foreword {-#Foreword}
I am Caleb Jin. This is my note of Bayesian linear regression model under the guidance of [Dr. Gyuhyeong Goh](https://sites.google.com/site/bayesiangoh/). It includes both derivative details, proof of lemma, ggplot and Rshiny to illustrate Bayesian linear regression model. In this way, I can organize my thought and benefit readers hopefully. Due to my very limited statistics knowledge, if making any mistakes, I sincerely expect you guys can email to me. My email address is jinsq@ksu.edu. Appreicate!
